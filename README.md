# Securing Your Kubernetes Ecosystem: A Holistic Approach to Supply Chain and Threat Modeling

### Introduction: The Interconnected Security Landscape (0-5 minutes) 

1. Securing Your Kubernetes Ecosystem: A Holistic Approach to Supply Chain and Threat Modeling
2. The Evolving Kubernetes Security Challenge: Briefly discuss the increasing complexity and attack surface of Kubernetes environments, emphasizing the need for both supply chain security and threat modeling. Explain how these two concepts are intertwined. A compromised supply chain directly impacts your threat model, and understanding your threat model helps you prioritize supply chain defenses.
3. Why Both? Explain that supply chain security focuses on preventing vulnerabilities from being introduced into your system, while threat modeling helps you understand and mitigate the potential impact of those vulnerabilities (and other threats). They are complementary.

### Kubernetes Architecture & Attack Surface (5-10 minutes)

4. Kubernetes Components (Simplified): Provide a simplified diagram of key Kubernetes components (API Server, etcd, kubelet, Controller Manager, Scheduler, Pods, Nodes, Namespaces).
5. Attack Surface in Detail: Explain the concept of the attack surface in the context of Kubernetes, relating it to the components shown in the previous slide. Highlight areas where supply chain vulnerabilities could manifest.

### Supply Chain Risks & Mitigations (Mapped to Architecture) (10-18 minutes) 

6. Code Stage Risks & Mitigations: Discuss code-level vulnerabilities (dependency vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets) and relate them to the development process and how they can propagate through the supply chain. Mention secure coding practices.
7. Build Stage Risks & Mitigations: Cover build process risks (compromised build environments, unverified base images) and their impact on the final container image. Introduce image scanning and signing.
8. Registry Stage Risks & Mitigations: Highlight registry-related risks (image tampering, public exposure) and the importance of secure registry configurations and vulnerability scanning.
9. Deploy Stage Risks & Mitigations: Discuss deployment-related risks (misconfigured RBAC, privileged containers) and how they can be mitigated using admission controllers and policy enforcement.
10. Runtime Stage Risks & Mitigations: Briefly mention runtime security concerns (container escape, node compromise) and the need for runtime monitoring and security tools.

### Threat Modeling & Mitigation Strategies (Overlaid on Supply Chain) (18-25 minutes) 

11. Threat Modeling Process: Briefly introduce the concept of threat modeling and a framework like STRIDE.
12. API Server Threats (Supply Chain & Direct): Discuss threats targeting the API server, including those originating from a compromised supply chain (e.g., malicious code in a container deployed via a compromised image) and direct attacks.
13. etcd Threats (Supply Chain & Direct): Cover etcd threats, including those related to compromised credentials or vulnerabilities in applications that interact with etcd, potentially introduced through the supply chain.
14. kubelet Threats (Supply Chain & Direct): Discuss kubelet threats, including container escape vulnerabilities that could be exacerbated by vulnerabilities introduced into container images via the supply chain.
15. Network Threats (Impact of Supply Chain): Explain how a compromised application introduced through the supply chain could lead to network attacks (e.g., a vulnerable application acting as a pivot point).
16. Mitigation Strategies (Holistic): Discuss mitigation strategies that address both supply chain and other threats, emphasizing the need for a layered approach:
  1. Secure configuration (RBAC, Network Policies)
  2. Vulnerability management (Image scanning, Node scanning)
  3. Access control
  4. Runtime security
  5. Security auditing and logging

Conclusion & Q&A (25-30 minutes) 

17. Key Takeaways: Summarize the interconnectedness of supply chain security and threat modeling.
18. Call to Action: Encourage attendees to assess their Kubernetes security posture holistically, considering both supply chain and other potential threats.
19. Q&A
